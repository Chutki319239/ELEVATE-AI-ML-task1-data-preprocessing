"Task 1 - Titanic dataset preprocessing with missing value handling, feature engineering, encoding, scaling, and outlier detection."

This repository contains the implementation of **Task 1: Data Preprocessing on the Titanic dataset**.  
The goal is to clean and preprocess the dataset so that it can be used for machine learning models.
